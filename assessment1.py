#write a brief description of all the
#following Object Types and Data Structures
#we've learned about:

#Numbers: integers in python that can be
#used in math, variable names, strings
#or to count.

#Strings: words, numbers or symbols that
#are stored between quotes that are typically
#used as output for the user to read, or for
#the programmer to debug. Often used in
#conjunction with print statements.

#Lists: are sets of values that can be stored
#and called upon to store and analyze information.

#Tuples: sets of  keys and corresponding 
#values that can be stored. However, these 
#values cannot be changed once stored; they
#are immutable.

#Dictionaries: sets of keys and values that
#can be stored and called upon. These keys
#and values are mutable.
